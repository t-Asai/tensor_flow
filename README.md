# tensor_flow

use google colab

First, I copied mnist_cnn.py to colab file.  
Second, I run colab with colab GPU.  
It works.  
Third, I modified cnn structure a little and re-run.  
It failed with resource exhausted.  
In some case it may not be our fault, then in such cases, wait.  
We can use GPU free.
